// bsp
as player manuevers through game, add player to corresponding part of tree
check only those parts of the tree

how are those parts made?????
how would splitting the polygons or boxes look in code???


//gl 4
give game one single buffers
generate buffers on init
set projection on init
find appropriate gl math lib for c, preferably one with matrix
matrix for model at 1.0f
create arrays for vertex, texel, bary, and uvs
bind each array to a buffer
don't forget to bind texture




// map
original controls for camera
arrow keys for selecting item to place
to place things under ceilings, don't draw ceilings (the sims) should be a toggle

make new map instance
create new file

move around via camera, (not mouse dat shyt is jank af)
place things with space button
need to find some way to draw wireframe cube where objects will be placed, or just show obj
will always place object at offset of camera, can be changed (the z axis, i think) with arrow keys up and down
left right switches items

when done placing things, press esc and level will save

if level system is working good enough, play level will always play map made in map editor

layout for map file
